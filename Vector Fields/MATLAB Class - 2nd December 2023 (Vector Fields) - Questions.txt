MATLAB Class - 2nd December 2023 (Vector Fields)

1. Draw the dimensional vector field for the vector (x)i + (y)j

2. Draw a three dimensional vector field for the vector (x)i + (y)j + (z)k

3. Find the gradient vector field of f(x, y) = x^2y - y^3. Plot the gradient vector field together with a contour map of f. How are they related?
Ans - The gradient vectors are orthogonal to the countours.

4. Find the curl and the divergence of the vector field, F(x, y, z) = (x^2yz)i + (xy^2z)j + (xyz^2)k

5. Determine whether or not the vector field, F(x, y, z) = (y^2z^3)i + (2xyz^3)j + (3xy^2z^2)k is conservative or not? If it is conservative, find a function f, such that F = grad f
