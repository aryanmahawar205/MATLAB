1st December MATLAB Class (Questions)

1. Draw a sphere of radius 5, centred at the origin (0,0,0) (Spherical Polar Coordinates)

2. Draw a hemisphere of radius 3 with centre at the origin (0,0,0)
(Spherical Polar Coordinates)

3. Evaluate the triple integral over E, where the integrand is e^sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2) dV, where E is enclosed by the sphere x^2+y^2+z^2 = 9 in the first octant
(Spherical Polar Coordinates)

4. Evaluate the triple integral (for volume) over E, where the integrand is z dV, where E is enclosed by the spheres x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1 and x^2+y^2+z^2 = 4 in the first octant
